# Pets By Daylight

Pets By Daylight is a web-based pet adoption application. Created with a MERN stack for the second project in COP 4331 by Group 10 in Fall 2023.


## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Chakra UI, React Router, React Auth Kit.

**Server:** Node, Express, MongoDB, Nodemon, Hardhat


## Deployment

**To deploy a local instance of this application:**  

  Navigate to client directory:  
```bash
  cd client
```
  Start local server hosting react frontend:  
```bash
  npm run dev
```
  In a new terminal, navigate to server directory:  
```bash
  cd server
```
  Start local server running express backend:  
```bash
  npm start
```
  
  **You Did it!**  
  Now you can begin development on your own local instance of the app. Since the front-end environment was created using vite and the backend start script runs using nodemon both the fronend and backend server will hot reload upon saving a file. No more refreshing the page after every change!
